# social-network-api-allen

No starter code was given out this week as we created a social networking application using MongoDB. Using Express and a MongoDB database, an app was created that lets users carry out expected social media functionalities such as creating, updating, and deleting users from the database. In addition to this, users can create and/or delete thoughts and reactions to these thoughts. 

Help on assignment was given by TAs in cirriculum and tutor Bobbi Tarkany.
